Next.JS | Clerk | Radix

ðŸŽ¯ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

Planning

- I used figma to design the home page, and figjam to create a general plan, wireframes, and database schemes
  Figma Design - https://www.figma.com/board/AZSHd0tPto0wAvnHNEtfmK/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=IwFxxA6z8aE8DMjP-1

User Stories

- As a user, I am able to sign up for an account and create a user profile
- As a user, I am able to log in and out of my account
- As a user, I am able to create posts on my profile timeline
- As a user, I am able to see all posts by all users on a global timeline
- As a user, I am able able to visit other user profiles

Requirements

- Use Clerk.com to set up user signup and login - The user can sign up, sign in, and sign out using Clerk
- Use the Clerk userId to associate posts with a user - Each post is associated with the user who created it
- Enable each user to create a profile associated with their userId, and a form to input their biography and location data, etc. with a URL similar to /user/[userId] - The use is prompted to create their profile with their details when they first log in
- Enable users to create posts associated with the userId, and display those posts on the user's profile page - users posts appear on their own profile page
- Show a 404 error if a user profile doesn't exist - I have an error.jsx in my user/[id] folder, which tells the user whether they need to sign in, or have visited a user page that doesnt exist
- Use at least 1 Radix UI Primitive or similar - In my app I have used an accordian Radix Primitive in my about page

Stretch Goals

- Enable users to visit other user profiles after seeing their posts on a global timeline - The user can click the username on the post to go to that user's profile
- A user's biography cannot be blank. If a user logs in but doesn't have a biography set, they should be asked to fill one in - The user has to fill out their whole profile info when they sign in for the first time

Extra Features

- Clerk profile picture url in database, appearing on user's posts on home page, and on own profile posts - configured in next.config.mjs
- The user is only able to see the update form on their own profile
- User must sign in to view user profiles
- ORDER BY friendposts.id DESC - posts are ordered by newest first, so when the user makes a post, it appears at the top of the feed rather than the bottom
- metadata for each page
- loading page for each page

Future Additions

- I would like the user to be able to follow other users, and have these stats appear on the user's profile page e.g 10 followers | 5 following. The user would also not be able to follow someone more than once
- I would like the user to be able to leave a like on a post, and see how many likes that post has. The user would also not be able to like a post more than once
- I would like to add animations to the app e.g when the user scrolls posts fade in etc.
- Alert dialogue when user clicks sign out

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

Some personal goals I wanted to achieve were allowing the user to like a post, or follow another user.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I found making the profile form component difficult to work, and also I found a lot of the radix primitives difficult to use, as I don't fully understand where I can use them if they are client components and most of my page functions use "use server"

âœ¨ What went really well and what could have gone better?

What Went Well

- Using tailwind!!
- Making the app responsive
- Using the supabase database and clerk

What Could Have Gone Better

- knowing how to use junction tables better, as I want the user to be able to like posts and follow users

âœ¨ Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.

Errors/Bugs

- I had a bug where the profile form component wouldn't appear when the user first logs in, and the username was returning as 'undefined' in the terminal, and only when it returned as null would the form appear? i removed one of the = signs as I read this makes it check for null or undefined and this seems to have worked - const hasUsername = result.rows[0]?.username != null ? true : false;

âœ¨ Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

Could I have some feedback about the bug I had, and also about the keys for the maps as I'm not entirely sure how to make sure all the children don't have the same key id.
